## Data collection
In this case, the choice has been made to use data from the United Nations. There are a large number of data sources on the internet that are freely available and quite comprehensive.
We are going to focus on: Intentional Homicides, Sex Crimes and Violent Crimes, Prison Deaths and Prison Inmates. In order to compare by regions around the world their crime rates and whether there are age or gender related determinants of crime.
